 Purpose: This code assumes that you've hacked the IR remote control of a hex bug
 to allow the Arduino to "push" the remote control's buttons.  You issue serial commands
 from the PC, which are received by the Arduino, when then interacts with the remote control.
 
 Hex Bug IR Remote: There are four buttons on the Hex Bug IR remote.   The high side of
 each button attached to the remote control's microcontroller, which must use a pull-up
 to hold the pin at 3.3V.  The low side of each button is connected to ground so that,
 when the button is pressed, the pin goes low by conducting through the now-closed button.
 
 Hack: I soldered a wire to the high side of each button and to the remote's "ground".
 I connect these wires to the Arduino. See my write-up at:

 Software Approach: Normally, the Arduino pins are set to "INPUT" because that makes
 the pins hae a high input impedance, which means that they do not affect the voltage
 at the pin to the microcontroller.  When I want the Arduino to "push" one of the
 buttons for me, I command the Arduino to change the pin to "OUTPUT" and "LOW",
 which gives a low-resistance path to ground.  As a result, it pulls the remote's
 microcontroller pin low, which makes the remote think that a button was pressed.

 Example Constructor:  HexBug_t hexBug(A1,A2,A3,A4,A5);  //use analog pins to control the Hex Bug
 Example Constructor:  HexBug_t hexBug(4,5,6,7,8);       //use digital pins to control the Hex Bug
 Example Command: hexBug.issueCommand(COMMAND_FIRE);     //issue the FIRE command
 Example Command: hexBug.parseCommandCharacter('P');     //issue the FOREWARD command using a character (as if from the Serial link)
 Example Update (call periodically): hexBug.update();    //stops issuing the current command after set period of time
